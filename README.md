# Devbox

## Are you copying https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox?

No, I guess great minds think alike. I came up with the project idea, name and the language of choice and devbox just so happened to already exist with the same name...same idea...and same language of implementation.

## What differentiates this project?
1. Feature parity - This project is a WIP.
1. Less dependent packages - I wrote devbox with the containerd client library so it doesn't depened on Docker or Nix while providing similar functionality. Buildkit based image creation coming soon™️.

## How do I use this?
You can't...yet.
